# Nikto-Exploitation-of-Web-Vulnerabilities-Using-DVWA-SQL-Injection-XSS-and-Command-Injection-

Overview:
This project focuses on exploiting common web vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Command Injection using the Nikto web server scanner in a secure Kali Linux environment. The testing is performed in a controlled virtual environment using the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) to simulate real-world attack scenarios. The project is part of a broader cybersecurity exercise to showcase offensive security techniques and discuss mitigation strategies.

Objective:
The primary goal is to demonstrate how Nikto can be utilized to identify and exploit web vulnerabilities. The project highlights:
- The importance of a secure, isolated testing environment.
- Practical steps for exploiting vulnerabilities like SQLi, XSS, and Command Injection.
- Best practices for remediation, including input validation, parameterized queries, and the principle of least privilege.

Environment Setup:
- Kali Linux: Used as the primary platform for running Nikto and other security tools.
- DVWA: Configured for vulnerability testing, simulating a real-world vulnerable web application.
- Virtual Environment: Ensures all tests and scans are conducted securely, preventing unintended impact on actual systems.

Vulnerabilities Exploited:
1. SQL Injection (SQLi): Demonstrated using manual exploitation techniques and automated tools like SQLMap to extract sensitive data from databases.
2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Exploited to capture session cookies and perform actions on behalf of other users.
3. Command Injection: Demonstrated how attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to potential full system compromise.

Tools and Technologies:
- Nikto: Utilized for vulnerability scanning and identifying exploitable points in the DVWA setup.
- SQLMap: Automated tool for exploiting SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
- Apache Web Server & PHP: Hosting the attack scripts and logging captured data.
- Kali Linux: Central hub for managing the testing environment and running the tools.
- Virtual Machines: Isolated setup with Kali and DVWA running in a secure network for controlled testing.

Exploitation Process:
- SQL Injection (SQLi): Exploiting the vulnerability to dump sensitive information like usernames and password hashes.
- XSS (Reflected): Injecting malicious scripts to capture cookies and hijack sessions.
- Command Injection: Executing arbitrary system commands through vulnerable input fields in DVWA.

Mitigation Strategies:
- Input Validation and Output Encoding: Ensuring all user inputs are sanitized and properly encoded before rendering.
- Use of `HttpOnly` Flag: Protecting session cookies from being accessed via JavaScript.
- Parameterized Queries: Preventing SQL Injection by using prepared statements.
- Content Security Policy (CSP): Implementing CSP headers to limit script sources and reduce XSS risks.
- Least Privilege: Restricting database and server access to the minimum necessary for functionality.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the significance of understanding both the offensive and defensive sides of cybersecurity. By simulating real-world attacks, the project highlights the critical vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit and offers actionable steps for remediation. The controlled environment ensures safe testing and provides an in-depth exploration of the attack surface while reinforcing the importance of continuous security assessment.
